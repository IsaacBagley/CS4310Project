# CS4310Project
The project for CS4310 at WMU from Isaac Bagley and Aiden Kim. A python sudoku solver.<br /><br />

# Project Description
The project will create and solve random sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm in Python. <br />
It will also have the ability to input a puzzle from another source and solve it. The project will also include a basic graphical user interface (GUI).<br /><br />
# Project Goals
The main goal for this project is to adhere to the timeline given by the instructor and create a program which functions correctly to give real answers to sudoku puzzles. <br />
The deadlines to be met are: <br />
preliminary specification and research document by 3/12/24<br />
design overview and testing overview document by 3/26/24 <br />
the completed project by 4/16/24.<br />

The functionality goals of the project include: <br />
only outputting correct solutions to sudoku puzzles <br /> 
reducing execution time as much as is feasibly possible<br />
the ability to take multiple sudoku puzzles input from a file and solve them. <br /><br />

A further goal would be to create an estimation function for the number of nodes required that is similar to the actual number of nodes required.
